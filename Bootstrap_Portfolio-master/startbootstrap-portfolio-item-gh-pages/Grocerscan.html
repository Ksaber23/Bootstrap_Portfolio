                <h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Grocerscan was a concept application designed for my research methods course in the Human Computer Interaction masterâ€™s program. The application was supposed to keep track of users purchases at the grocery store, rewarding users who bought healthier foods. The system was gamified, so that users could compete with other friends for the top health score  Several UX research methods were applied to create the interface of the application.  First, interviews were conducted with target users as well as professionals. I was responsible for interviewing a nutritionist and what I found is that people generally have different diet plans that work for them. One homogeneous diet point system would not work, so our application would be designed to include a variety of ways to score points. I also interviewed a cyber security consultant, to understand how the infrastructure of the application might be realized. Wireframes were developed in Proto.io and Axure to understand how the interface was going to be laid out. We then linked the pages to be a full prototype. The full pages were analyzed using cognitive walkthroughs, and another iteration of the design was taken place.  We then presented our idea to our Research Methods course, and later on to Quest, which is a professional academic conference that our school hosts once a year. </p>
